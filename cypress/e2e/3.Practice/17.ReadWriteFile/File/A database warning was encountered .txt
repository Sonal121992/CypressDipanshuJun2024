A database warning was encountered performing the requested operation:

ORA-28002: the password will expire within 7 days
28002. 00000 -  "the password will expire within %s days"
*Cause:    The password of the user's account expired and entered the
           grace period and should be changed. This can happen if any of the
           following is true:
           * The user account was associated with a password profile with
           a limited password grace period.
           * The user account was created as part of either a database
           import inside a Pluggable Database (PDB) or clone of an
           existing PDB and the user's password did not meet the
           requirements of the mandatory profile (that was configured
           with a limited password grace period) enforced in the PDB.
           Since the password grace period has not yet elapsed, the user is
           not prompted to input a new password and an ORA-28002 warning
           message will continue to be displayed upon each successful login
           to the user account, until the user changes their password.
           After the grace period has elapsed, the password expires and until
           the user successfully changes their password their login will
           continue to fail with an ORA-28001 error.
*Action:   Change the password or contact the database administrator to
           understand the rules for choosing the new password which complies
           with the mandatory profile.
